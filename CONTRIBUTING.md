# Production Process

All updates to the documents in this repository are made via pull requests (PRs)
submitted via the GitHub user interface.  Anyone may submit a PR.  See below for
more information about how PRs are reviewed and merged/closed.

As these documents are currently individual drafts (I-Ds), in the IETF sense, it
is not yet necessary to get consensus for changes made here.

Ultimately, this document will be submitted to the NETMOD WG for consideration
for adoption.  At that time, WG consensus will be held for all of the updates
made up to that point.

However, until then, given the complexity of this effort, all updates (PRs) are
subject to a GitHub-enabled review process.  Only the designated experts (i.e., the
`rfc7950bis-owners` team) and the PR-owner(s) participate in the review process.

A PR will be automatically-merged as soon as all of the following are true:
  - The PR is up-to-date with the current `main` branch.
  - All automated GitHub Workflow Actions pass (xml2rfc, idnits, etc.).
  - There are at least three "approvals".
  - There are no "request changes".
  - All "conversations" resolved

Disclaimer: as no "experts" have been "designated" yet, the Editor has been
force-merging the PRs.  This hasn't been an issue so far, as the changes to
date have been editorial.  As soon as experts have been designated, the
ability for the Editor to force-merge will be removed.

In order to facilitate this process, it is expected that each PR will focus
on a single item, albeit taking it to completion.  That is, the PR completely
updates all three documents, as needed.  For instance, in addition to the
primary update, the PR must (as needed) update ancillarly sections:
  - Summary of Changes from RFC 7950
  - IANA Considerations
  - Security Considerations
  - Normative References
  - Informative References
  - Acknowledgements
  - etc.

A checklist for such things is automatically attached to PRs when they
are opened to ensure these updates occur.

For complex issues, aspiring PR authors are encouraged to request
a "kickoff" discussion with the designated experts by creating a
"design" (a Markdown file in the `/designs` directory) and submitting
a PR to add just that file to the repository.  Doing so triggers the
exact same merge-requirements listed above so, once the "design PR"
is merged, it is safe to proceed with the settled-upon approach.

Please note that, once these documents is adopted as a NETMOD WG document,
the same PR-process discussed above will continue with one modification:
instead of PRs being automatically-merged, they will instead block on
the Editor to ensure there is WG-consensus for the change.

Note that this is a necessary but largely perfunctorial gesture, as already
the update was approaved by the designated experts, leaving little room
for an objection to be raised.


# Build Artifacts

Each PR-update and PR-merge causes a GitHub Workflow to execute that generates and
publishes build artifacts (the draft compiled in its various formats) to be published to the
[Build artifacts for rfc7950bis and friends](https://netmod-wg.github.io/rfc7950bis-and-friends)
page.


# Attribution

As an experiment, the "author list" is automatically calculated by sorting all of the
GitHub-contributors by "total" lines added, removed, and changed.  If you want to be
listed as an author, you must contribute to a PR that gets merged.  Of course, the
"designated experts" may contribute PRs too, but they cannot review their own PR ;)
